<h3>The Story</h3>
The Diamondians have for thousands of years lived peacefully with humankind in the shadows.<br>
They have long held great esteem for all the beings on Earth, and every planet they cohabitate with the native species<br>
War, famine, and disease have never affected them before, but humans recently began using their Diamond bodies to make jewelry, and have been poaching them for it.<br>
<br>
Now the Diamondians must learn how to defend themselves against the humans who would rather see them as jewelry than as neighbors.
